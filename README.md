# CFD-modeling-of-simple-flows-with-one-or-two-Newtonian-fluids
The present work analyzes the methods and procedures of numerical flow modeling through the solution of the Navier–Stokes equations for applications involving simple flows with one or two fluids. An introduction to the theoretical background of the study is first provided, followed by a detailed presentation of the numerical methods that were and applied for the simulations. The advantages of each method are discussed, along with a step-by-step description of the approach used to model such flow problems. Finally, the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the obtained results are analyzed, and the main conclusions of the study are presented.
